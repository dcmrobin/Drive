Make the car repairable.

Make the car have changable tires... so that maybe when a tire gets shot by the gun, it comes off?

Make the terrain better. (More structures? Mountains? Hills?)

Add sound!

Make the car customizable. Maybe have spray-paint cans which can change the color of certain bits of the car?

Make the crosshair into something else when the gun is pointed at another player.

Make the ability to ride in any seat of the car.

Better car acceleration!
