#BUGS#

When player is driving and reaches a certain speed, the car thinks the player is crashing into it, and the player dies.
(I can't reproduce this bug while I'm playing multiplayer by myselft... it's when a player is riding a car that another player
spawned for the first time that it happens, and it only happens when the car's speed reaches 20 m/s.)
