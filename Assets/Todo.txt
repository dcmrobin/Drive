Make the car repairable.

Make the car have changable tires... so that maybe when a tire gets shot by the gun, it comes off?

Make the terrain better. (More structures? Mountains? Hills?)

Add sound!

Make the car customizable. Maybe have spray-paint cans which can change the color of certain bits of the car?

Make the crosshair into something else when the gun is pointed at another player.


#BUGS#

something is wrong with the ammo syncing between players... ammo is not updated when player enters the game, and
that means that when a player enters the game, the player that was there before sees that the gun's ammo is 0,
which is normal, but the player who has just entered sees it as 5.
