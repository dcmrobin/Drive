Make the car repairable.

Make the car have changable tires... so that maybe when a tire gets shot by the gun, it comes off?

Make the terrain better. (More structures? Mountains? Hills?)

Add sound!

Make the car customizable. Maybe have spray-paint cans which can change the color of certain bits of the car?

Maybe add creatures (Maybe some could be hostile?) that can be found all over the world?

Add the ability to get hurt by a fast moving car (the damage inflicted by the car depends on how fast the car is going)


#BUGS#
when player enters room, the health bar of the opposite player returns to full health! the actual player's health is still the same, but the screenspace healthbar is bugged.
