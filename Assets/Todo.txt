Make the car repairable.

Make the car have changable tires... so that maybe when a tire gets shot by the gun, it comes off?

Make the terrain better. (More structures? Mountains? Hills?)

Add sound!

Make the car customizable. Maybe have spray-paint cans which can change the color of certain bits of the car?

Make the crosshair into something else when the gun is pointed at another player.
